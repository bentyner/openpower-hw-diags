# Hardware Diagnostics for POWER Systems

In the event of a system fatal error reported by the internal system hardware
(processor chips, memory chips, I/O chips, system memory, etc.), POWER Systems
have the ability to diagnose the root cause of the failure and perform any
service action needed to avoid repeated system failures.

Aditional details TBD.
